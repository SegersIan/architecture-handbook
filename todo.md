## Topics to cover - AKA THE TODO
* What is Software Enterprise Architecture
* How to do Enterprise Architecture 
    * Understand the perceived role of IT
    * Translate the business Strategy into IT strategy
    * Create Transparancy
    * Define the target picture
    * Create a roadmap to get from the current to target picture
    * Govern/Harmonize the exection of the plan
    * Obtain process about the process and refine
    * Coach and mentor the people on the journey/road
    * Somewhere side track from this steps in also things like Business capabilities and such.
* How to get "TRUST" from the engineering team, and how to measure it (doing surveys for example)
* How to get architecture in the "AGILE" or "SAFE" ecosystem ?
* How to get architecture adapted all together
* What are architectural styles and can they co-exist ?
* Where/how does "clean Architecture" fit in ?
* Make a good split and difference between architecture and enterprise architecture
* What is the difference between architecture and design, or "systen design".
* Consider on how to discuss the points of Software Architecture and the hard parts book
* Consider how the architect elevator fits the big picture.
* Discuss the architectural styles
* Evolutionary Architecture - Go deeper with the fitness function and such. Circle back to "Defining charachteristics".
* Discuss managed evolution, but go deeper, what it solves or does. Like, IT allignment. Circle that back to the enterprise architecture and understand how the role of IT is perceived and the relation.
* Discuss evolutionary psychology
* Emphasize how 'data' and *'relations/connections* impact architecture.
* The concepts of "lenses/views" and how they can be used. Which are they, and when to use which ones?
* Role of conways law in architecture
* Operational aspects of architects
    * Architectural Decision Records
    * Record exceptions
    * Exceptions are ok, just measure how many you make.
* Look at managed evolution KPIs
* Make a throrough list of fitness function examples
* Make a reference list of all the -ilities that we can think off.
* Domain Events, Event Driven Architecure, Even Sourcing...

* "Emerging design/architecture"
* Add also something about all the database reading models, like eventual consistency and such. Cause this is very important when architecting or designing stuff, and the what you should take in consideration.

    * Also see the Data instensive applications
* Nuggets of wisdom list
    * Don't split services/domains on "entity", entity driven design I call it. Cause where goes to the entity independent, or aggregate of enttities business logic?
    * Your thoughts on the DRY principle, and using the rule of 3. You want to apply DRY for code that changes at the same time, for the same actor/end user. (e.g. a logic for a user vs admin that seems similar at first).
* Technology radar and application radar
