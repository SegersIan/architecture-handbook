# General Anti-Patterns

A general set of anti-patterns that might not immediately find place or belong to a specific topic.

## Anti-Pattern: Frozen Cavemen

An architect who always reverts back to their pet irrational concern for every architecture. Manifests in architects who have been burned in the past by a poor decision or unexpected occurrence, making them particularly cautious in the future. Risk assessment is important, but should be realistic as well.

## Anti-Pattern: Architecture By Implication

Developers make design decisions implicitly rather than explicitly, which can lead to a poorly defined and chaotic architecture. This anti-pattern often emerges when teams lack experience, proper communication, or sufficient design documentation, causing developers to assume that their colleagues share their understanding of the system's design.
