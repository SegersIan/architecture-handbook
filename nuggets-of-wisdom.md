# Nuggets Of Wisdom

> When a team builds a system primarily around reuse, they also incur a huge amount of coupling between components.

> When an architect designs a system that favors reuse, they also favor coupling to achieve that reuse, either by inheritance or composition.
> However; if the architect's goal requires high degrees of decoupling,then they favor duplication over reuse.

> Don't try to find the *best* design in software architecture; instead, strive for the *least worst* combination of trade-offs.

> Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.

> There are no right or wrong answers in architecture - only trade-offs

> A second common style of definition for architecture is that it's “the design decisions that need to be made early in a project”, but Ralph complained about this too, saying that it was more like the decisions you wish you could get right early in a project. His conclusion was that “Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is” - *([Martin fowler](https://martinfowler.com/architecture/))*
> Note that "what is important" means that (expert) developers decide what is important, a simple webapp, the DB could be important, but for a medical imaging app, a detail.
