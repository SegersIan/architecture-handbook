> When a team builds a system primarily around reuse, they also incur a huge amount of coupling between components.

> When an architect designs a system that favors reuse, they also favor coupling to achieve that reuse, either by inheritance or composition.
> However; if the architect's goal requires high degrees of decoupling,then they favor duplication over reuse.

> Don't try to find the *best* design in software architecture; instead, strive for the *least worst* combination of trade-offs.
